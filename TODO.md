# TODO

Running list of things worth revisiting. Add an entry when you find something real
but out of scope for the change you are making, so it does not get lost in a commit
message.

## Authorization

Both entries below came out of building `tests/rls` (see AGENTS.md §7). The suite is
green: neither of these is an isolation failure, and neither blocks anything today.

### Members without a grant are told their write succeeded when it did not

**Action:** decide whether self-service writes need a default grant, or whether the
actions should stop reporting success. It is a product call, which is why it was left.

`create`/`edit`/`delete` default to scope `'none'`, and the composed RLS policies
(`20260618000001`) honour that — so a plain member's write matches zero rows. The
actions do not check how many rows they changed, and PostgREST does not treat an
empty match as an error, so they return `{ success: true }`:

| called by a member with no grants | returns | actually happened |
|---|---|---|
| `updateChild` | `{success:true}` | nothing |
| `deletePhoto` | `{success:true}` | nothing |
| `tagPersonInPhoto` | RLS error, surfaced honestly | nothing |

Verified against a local database: all three work once the caller is granted the
resource at scope `'any'`, so the cause is the missing grant and not the action. The
user-visible version of this is a parent renaming their own child, being told it
saved, and finding it unchanged on reload.

Two separable questions, and they have different answers:

1. *Should a member be able to manage their own child / their own photo without an
   administrator granting it?* If yes, seed the grants — probably in the
   `20260618000000` seed so new families get them too.
2. *Should an action ever report success for a write that changed nothing?* Almost
   certainly not, regardless of how (1) is answered. Selecting the affected rows back
   (`.select()` on the mutation) turns a silent no-op into a real failure message.

`tests/rls` currently runs these positive controls as an ALPHA administrator, so it
stays green either way. If (1) changes, switch those cases back to `alphaMember` —
that is the assertion that would then be meaningful.

### `tests/rls` does not cover the Storage-backed uploads

**Action:** extend the harness, or decide the risk is acceptable and say so.

Not covered: `uploadDocument`, `uploadPhoto`, `uploadEventPhoto`, `uploadAvatar` —
listed in `UNCOVERED` at the bottom of `tests/rls/cases.mjs`.

They take a `FormData` carrying a file and write to Supabase Storage, whose bucket
policies are a **separate access-control system** from the RLS policies the suite
exercises. Nothing in this work says anything about whether one family can read or
overwrite another's objects. Doing it properly means seeding buckets and asserting on
object paths, which is a different harness rather than three more cases.

## Review

### Dead code: `components/admin/AdminChaptersClient.tsx`

**Action:** review, then most likely delete.

Nothing imports it — the only match for `AdminChaptersClient` in the repo is its own
definition. It was superseded by two components that split its job:

- [AdminRegionsChaptersClient.tsx](components/admin/AdminRegionsChaptersClient.tsx) —
  rendered by [admin/chapters/page.tsx](<app/(protected)/admin/chapters/page.tsx>)
- [AdminUserRolesClient.tsx](components/admin/AdminUserRolesClient.tsx) —
  rendered by [admin/user-roles/page.tsx](<app/(protected)/admin/user-roles/page.tsx>)

Before deleting, confirm neither live component is missing anything the dead one does
— the chapter and custom-role forms look equivalent, but that has not been diffed
carefully.

Two notes if it is instead kept and wired up:

- Its role form calls `createCustomRole`, which revalidates `/admin/user-roles` only —
  not `/admin/chapters`. Harmless today because the create handler calls
  `router.refresh()` explicitly, which refetches the current route regardless.
- It was included in the server-data-freshness sweep (it uses `useServerState` and
  `router.refresh()` like its live siblings), so it is not stale in that respect.

Found while auditing the site for lists that ignored newly created rows.
