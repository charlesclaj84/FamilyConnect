## Review

### Dead code: `components/admin/AdminChaptersClient.tsx`

**Action:** review, then most likely delete.

Nothing imports it — the only match for `AdminChaptersClient` in the repo is its own
definition. It was superseded by two components that split its job:

- [AdminRegionsChaptersClient.tsx](components/admin/AdminRegionsChaptersClient.tsx) —
  rendered by [admin/chapters/page.tsx](<app/(protected)/admin/chapters/page.tsx>)
- [AdminUserRolesClient.tsx](components/admin/AdminUserRolesClient.tsx) —
  rendered by [admin/user-roles/page.tsx](<app/(protected)/admin/user-roles/page.tsx>)

Before deleting, confirm neither live component is missing anything the dead one does
— the chapter and custom-role forms look equivalent, but that has not been diffed
carefully.

Two notes if it is instead kept and wired up:

- Its role form calls `createCustomRole`, which revalidates `/admin/user-roles` only —
  not `/admin/chapters`. Harmless today because the create handler calls
  `router.refresh()` explicitly, which refetches the current route regardless.
- It was included in the server-data-freshness sweep (it uses `useServerState` and
  `router.refresh()` like its live siblings), so it is not stale in that respect.

Found while auditing the site for lists that ignored newly created rows.
