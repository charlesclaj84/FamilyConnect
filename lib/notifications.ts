/**
 * Notification writers, for server code to call — NOT server actions.
 *
 * These live here, and not in app/actions/notifications.ts, precisely because they
 * must not be reachable from a browser. Both take `familyCode` as an argument and
 * write with the service-role client, so as exported members of a `'use server'`
 * module they were public endpoints: anyone signed in could post any family's code
 * with an arbitrary title, body and LINK, and have it appear in the notification bell
 * of every member of that family. A plain module has no URL.
 *
 * The rule this came from, in AGENTS.md: everything exported from a `'use server'`
 * file is an endpoint. "Internal helper" is a comment, not a boundary.
 *
 * A caller must therefore pass a `familyCode` it has already established belongs to
 * the acting user — `getMyFamilyCode(user.id)`, never a value from the client.
